# Ideas
///
I need to decide exactly what the flows is of the game for when the user signs in.
maybe:
sign in -> 


when the computer figures out one digit it haas the cypher gif that is able to crack the first letter.


Incorporate Amusing User Experience
Add entertaining messages or animations to display during the waiting period.
Make the waiting period interactive or engaging for the user.
For example: the enigma of alan turing cracked the german cypher in X amopunt of time and shortened the war for a few years. have fun facts like these in the app.
////
have it so the user chooses level: easy, medium, hard and then this bases how many questions will be asked after the user guess the password.
and the questions asked will be things like:
- is there any letters?"
is there any numbers?
any upper case?
any lower case?
special characters?

maybe we can have the user decide which questions it wants to answer

when the computer is thinking then a gif will be shown life a lock is being unlocked and broken into

the user will find it amusing how long it takes for his password to be broken































# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
